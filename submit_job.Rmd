## Submitting a job to HPC

Let's say you want to submit a simple job of indexing a reference sequence. The command to index a reference sequence is 

```
bowtie2-build -f myreference.fasta myreference_index.fasta
```

However, you should not run the above command on the login node (or submission node/Head node). The login node is a server with very limitted resources for managing the users who are logged in. To submit the above command to the HPC from the login node, you will need to create a bash job script with that command in it.

You can create a bash script using any visual editor. In command line, vi and nano are popular editors. Let's try to create bash script using nano.

After you are logged in to HPC, type 
```
nano index.sh
```

nano will create a file called index.sh, if it does not exist and open it. Copy and paste these code in the editor now.

```
#!/bin/bash

# SLURM --mem=10G  # memory requirement for the job
# SLURM -o index.log  # output file for any log
# SLURM -J index-reference   # a job name to indentify job in HPC
# SLURM -e index.err  # error output filename if error occurs
# SLURM -p tsl-long   # TSL HPC partition name, other partitions- tsl-short, tsl-medium
# SLURM -n 1  # number of tasks to run
# SLURM -N  # number of nodes

source bowtie2-2.3.5

bowtie2-build -f myreference.fasta myreference_index.fasta
```

Press ctrl+o to write/save the file and ctrl+x to exit the nano editor.

As you see, there are many lines added, not just the bowtie2-build command to generate index files. We will go through what these lines are:

Line 1:  #!/bin/bash : This line basically says the the script is a bash script and the bash executable file to run this script is in the path /bin/bash.
Line 3 - 9 : These lines specifies the resources we are asking the HPC SLURM job manager to run the job. The annotated text in the script says that explicitly.
Line 11: source bowtie2-2.3.5 - This line adds the bowtie2 executable files in your working environment. If you don't do this, the next command will to build the index will fail because bowtie2-build command will not be found. For a test, type "which bowtie2-build" in the terminal and hit enter, it will say the "bowtie2-build command not found", now type "source bowtie2-2.3.5" and hit enter, type "which bowtie2-build" again and hit enter, this time it will show the path to the executable file bowtie2-build. This is because after sourcing the bowtie2-2.3.5, the path to the executable files are added to you environment. To see what are the paths in your environment, type "echo $PATH".

Line 13: This is the command to index the reference sequence with the command bowtie2-build.

Now it's the time to run the job in the HPC cluster. Type the command
```
sbatch index.sh
```

## Cancel a running job

Sometime a pending or running job needs to be canceled/killed. The scancel command is used to terminate a job managed by Slurm scheduler.

You will need your jobid or jobname to cancel the job. You can view the jobs queued using the squeue command and then copy the jobid or jobname.

To cancel a job by jobid

```
scancel jobid
```

To cancel a job by jobname

```
scancel -n jobname
scancel --jobname jobname
```

To cancel all jobs running in a partition

```
scancel --partition tsl-long
scancel -p tsl-short
```

To cancel all jobs running in a particular node/s

```
scancel --nodelist=t128n5,t256n1
scancel -w t12n5,t256n1
```
